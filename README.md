C# Lambda Events for Objective-c


C# Events with Lambdas are just so damned elegant at hooking up dynamic code to fire upon an event...and it turns out
we can have almost the same thing in objective-C with this library!

My hope is that this will spare developers from having to use the previous methods of 
 - NSNotificationCentre (pain to setup)
 - Delegate pattern (pain to setup, and file bloat)
 - Selectors (Pain to setup)
